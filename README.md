# Quantile differences

This short script aims at implementing the method derived by [Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val et Melly (2013)](http://www.mit.edu/~vchern/papers/counterfactual_2012Nov1.pdf).

In a nutshell, rather than decomposing differences around the mean of a variable (see Oaxaca-Blinder for instance), the current method decomposes differences on the full distribution of a variable.to accurately decompose differences between two distributions of a variable.
